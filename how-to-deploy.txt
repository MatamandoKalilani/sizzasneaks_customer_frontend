Start by making sure all finished branches have been merged to the main branch on GitHub.
Then move to the main branch on your computer then pull all those changes.
After this, the commands bellow can be executed to create the build and deploy it to firebase. 

Since Firebase hosting has already been set up. All that is needed, is to 
- npm run build
    This will genetate a build version of the app and put it in the build folder.
- firebase deploy
    This will then deploy that build folder that you have created above.
